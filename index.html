        <h1>How FX Fees on Credit Cards Actually Work</h1>
        <p class="hero-lead">
          When you pay in another currency, several layers of pricing kick in: network rate, issuer markup,
          “0% FX” campaigns and sometimes dynamic currency conversion. This page breaks down where the
          cost really comes from.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Foreign Exchange (FX) Fee?</h2>
      <p>
        An FX fee is the extra cost you pay when a purchase is billed in a different currency than your
        card’s billing currency. The card network (Visa, Mastercard, etc.) converts the transaction at
        their daily wholesale rate, and your card issuer may add an additional percentage on top.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typical setups include:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside small">
        <li><strong>Network rate only:</strong> issuer passes on the card network rate with no extra FX markup.</li>
        <li><strong>Network rate + issuer fee:</strong> an added 1–3% “foreign transaction fee”.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic currency conversion (DCC):</strong> merchant or ATM converts at its own rate, often worse.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Even “no foreign transaction fee” cards still use an underlying FX rate. The difference is whether the
        issuer adds their own markup on top of the network’s rate.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mechanics -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Currency Conversion Flows Behind the Scenes</h2>
      <p>
        When you tap or insert your card in another currency, the terminal sends the transaction in the
        <em>local currency</em> to the card network. The network converts the amount to your billing currency
        using its daily rate, then forwards the converted amount to your issuer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The issuer may then:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside small">
        <li>Apply a fixed FX markup (for example 2.0–2.5% on the converted amount).</li>
        <li>Apply an additional “foreign transaction fee” that also covers extra processing costs.</li>
        <li>Apply <strong>no</strong> additional FX fee at all (common on travel cards marketed as “0% FX”).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The effective cost of spending abroad is therefore:
      </p>
      <p class="small">
        <strong>Real cost ≈ (network FX rate difference vs. interbank) + issuer FX markup + any ATM/merchant surcharges.</strong>
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- DCC and ATMs -->
    <section id="dcc" class="section">
      <h2>Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) &amp; ATM FX</h2>
      <p>
        Dynamic currency conversion (DCC) is when a terminal or ATM offers to charge you in your <em>home</em>
        currency instead of the local one. It sounds convenient, but the exchange rate is chosen by the merchant
        or their provider, not by the card network.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typical risk points with DCC and ATMs:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside small">
        <li><strong>Higher markups:</strong> DCC rates can be several % worse than network rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Extra ATM fees:</strong> fixed surcharges per withdrawal plus FX markup on top.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple layers:</strong> ATM fee + DCC markup + potential issuer FX fee.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many travellers prefer to <strong>decline DCC</strong> (“charge me in local currency”) and let their card
        handle the conversion, especially if they use a card with 0% FX markup.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 0% FX & marketing -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>“0% FX” Cards – What to Check Carefully</h2>
      <p>
        Cards advertised as “no foreign transaction fee” usually waive the issuer’s FX markup, but you should still
        check:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside small">
        <li><strong>Applies to all currencies?</strong> Some cards exclude certain regions or online purchases.</li>
        <li><strong>ATM withdrawals:</strong> 0% FX might not cover cash withdrawals, only card purchases.</li>
        <li><strong>Other fees:</strong> higher annual fee or cash withdrawal charges can offset the FX savings.</li>
        <li><strong>Rewards trade-off:</strong> some 0% FX cards offer weaker rewards compared with domestic-focused cards.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For frequent travellers, a true 0% FX markup card combined with smart use of local-currency billing can
        significantly reduce the cost of spending abroad.
