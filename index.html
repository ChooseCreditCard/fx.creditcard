    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Foreign Transaction Fee?</h2>
      <p>In product documentation, a foreign transaction fee is normally listed as a percentage applied when a transaction is processed in a currency different from the account currency, or routed through a foreign acquirer. It is separate from interest and other fees, and may apply even if the amount appears in your home currency on the receipt.</p>
      <p>Some cards advertise “no foreign transaction fees”, while others add a surcharge of a few percent on top of the underlying exchange rate. The precise wording in the pricing section determines whether the fee applies based on currency, location of the merchant’s bank, or both.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mechanics / FX processing -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Currency Conversion and FX Processing Actually Happen</h2>
      <p>When you use a card outside your home currency, there are usually two main conversion paths:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Network conversion</strong> – the card network (for example Visa or Mastercard) converts the transaction at its daily wholesale FX rate and passes the result to the issuer.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic currency conversion (DCC)</strong> – the merchant or their provider converts the amount into your home currency at a rate they control, often shown on the terminal as an “instant conversion” option.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Issuer documentation may state whether network FX rates, issuer markups or merchant-provided rates are used, and under which circumstances an additional foreign transaction fee or cross-border fee is charged. Some issuers treat DCC transactions differently for both pricing and rewards.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Cross-Border Processing, Online Purchases and Hidden FX</h2>
      <p>Not all foreign transaction fees are linked to travel. Online purchases from international merchants can also be routed through foreign acquirers. In some cases, a fee may apply even when the charge appears in your home currency on your statement.</p>
      <p>Documentation sometimes distinguishes between:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Transactions in a foreign currency processed abroad.</li>
        <li>Transactions in a foreign currency processed domestically.</li>
        <li>Transactions in your home currency processed abroad.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These distinctions determine when FX-related fees are triggered and how they appear on your statement. They also affect how different cards behave for the same purchase scenario.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>FX Costs, Rewards and Travel-Focused Design</h2>
      <p>Travel-focused cards may reduce or remove FX fees, or provide rewards that partially offset the cost of spending abroad. Documentation may highlight:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Whether foreign transaction fees are set to 0% for purchases.</li>
        <li>How reward points or miles are earned on foreign currency transactions.</li>
        <li>Any exclusions relating to DCC or specific merchant categories.</li>
        <li>Additional travel benefits bundled with the card, such as insurance or lounge access.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>From a documentation standpoint, these features are best viewed together: FX pricing, reward structures and travel protections form a combined design for international card use.</p>
